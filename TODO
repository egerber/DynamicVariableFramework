PROBLEMS:
- So far, there is no way to make an assignment (for example to a delayed variable) in the form of var=new_value. In this case the instance of DynamicVariable would be replaced
by new_value



TODO:
- Class dynamics of a group sharing a ressource
- Autoscaling for monitor
- addLines from dynamicArray and plot specific indices from it

THINKABOUT:
plot all previous values but only display range of current ones => can navigate in history
- How to dynamically delete data from logger
